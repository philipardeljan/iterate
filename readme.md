## iterate.css ðŸŽ¨
* Assumptionless functional CSS library focused on iterating your UI
* 1kb of CSS

### What is it though?
Implementing a functional CSS methodology right off the bat can be hard. This is a small snippet of CSS that sits on top of everything that gives you the benefit to immediately start refining UI. **It contains:**
* `border-radius`
* `border-position`
* `border-width`
* `top/bottom/left/right`
* `clearfix`
* `cursor pointer`
* `display (TODO: Complete flex properties)`
* `floats`
* `font-size`
* `font-style`
* `font-weight`
* `margins`
* `paddings`
* `overflow`
* `max-width`
* `position`
* `text-align`
* `text-transform`
* `vertical-alignment`

I haven't included any text/background/border colours or any media queries. This is on purpose. iterate.css is just a thin layer of CSS. It is not meant to be a complete CSS toolkit like Tachyons or BassCSS. If you want to define a design system using functional CSS please use those tools instead.
