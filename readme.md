## iterate.css ðŸŽ¨
* Assumptionless functional CSS library focused on iterating your UI
* 1kb of CSS

### What is it though?
* Implementing a functional CSS methodology right off the bat can be hard. This is a small snippet of CSS that sits on top of everything that gives you the benefit to immediately start refining UI.
* **It contains:**
* floats
* paddings
* margins
* borders
* positioning
* display
* font-size
* font-weights
* text alignment
* clearfix

I haven't included any text/background/border colours. This is on purpose. iterate.css is just a thin layer of CSS. It is not meant to be a complete CSS toolkit like Tachyons or BassCSS. If you want to define a design system using functional CSS please use those tools instead.
